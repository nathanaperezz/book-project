This is a project I made for my OOP class. 
The user can add books as either library or bookstore books, which are then stored in an array of objects. 
Both types of books store the title, author, and isbn, but bookstore books store an additional price and sale. 
This project was made before learning inheritance, I then created a similar project using inheritance. This really proved to me how valuable inheritance can be. 
The program will print your books for you and tell you the total numbers of each.
